# Cars-Data-Analysis

**Problem Statement:**

With the growing emphasis on fuel efficiency and vehicle performance, analyzing historical vehicle data can provide valuable insights. This study aims to explore trends in fuel efficiency (MPG), the impact of engine specifications (horsepower, cubic inches, and cylinders), and regional preferences for vehicle attributes. The key challenges include handling data inconsistencies, deriving meaningful relationships, and visualizing trends effectively.

**Proposed Solution:**

To address these challenges, we follow these steps:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Load, clean, and inspect the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Summarize key attributes and analyze statistical features.
- **Visualization:** Use graphs to identify trends in fuel efficiency, engine performance, and regional vehicle preferences.
- **Insights:** Determine relationships between MPG, horsepower, cubic inches, and cylinders to infer trends in vehicle performance.
